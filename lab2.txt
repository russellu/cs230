lab 2:

GOAL OF LAB
1) save UI state on configuration change (rotate device)
2) create a settings menu accessible through the App Bar using Fragment

SPECS: I will test your app using the following procedure:

1) rotating the device to ensure button state is saved on a configuration change
if the button is marked with an 'X' or an 'O', a configuration change (rotation)
should not wipe the buttons (ie, the button state should be saved and then restored)

2) i should be able to click access some type of options menu from the app bar, and
then select "Settings" which will open a new screen (using a fragment or activity) displaying
several adjustable settings. the settings don't need to be functional (they don't have to actually
affect the app) but you can make them so if you want. 

3) from the settings screen, i should be able to tap the back button to return to the game

in MainActivity:
override public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState) 
(store information about button state)

override public void onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState) 
(load information about button state)

optionally, use ViewModel instead to save button state:
